### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tom, an aspiring Data Analyst, who has recently emigrated to the US from the UK! 

I am self taught in SQL, PowerBI and Tableau. I am also currently tackling Python and it's many uses in the data world

### Background

Over the last 9 years I have been working in finance & accounting, often using large complex datasets . During this time I completed my accounting studies :book:, working towards a CPFA (Charted Public Finance Accountant) status.

I also hold a Masters degree in Physics, further highlighting my analytic mind and nature.
